# terraform-provider-dadcorp

This is a sample provider developed for the HashiCorp Live livestream about the new [terraform-plugin-go](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-go) and [terraform-plugin-mux](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-mux) packages.

This provider was created for demonstration purposes only. It does not reflect best practices or necessarily even correct provider development code. It is published for illustrative purposes only, it should not be used as a scaffold for provider development or an illustration of patterns.
